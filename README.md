# HelpMate.Core

A tiny helper for writing .NET Core applications. This library provides a simple set of extension methods that you can use to perform common validations and conversions in C#.

# Installation
1. Download and Install the latest `HelpMate.Core` from NuGet or via CLI:

```
PM> Install-Package HelpMate.Core -Version 1.1.0
```

2. Declare the following namespace in the class:

```csharp
using HelpMate.Core;
```

# Sample Usage
Assuming you would want to convert a `string` value to a `DateTime` object type. To handle this, you would probably use one of the built-in methods in .NET such as the [Convert.ToDateTime()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.convert.todatetime?view=netcore-3.1) method.

```csharp
string dateString = "6/10/2020";
var date = Convert.ToDateTime(dateString);
``` 

That should work perfectly as we expect, however that will throw a `System.FormatException` if you are trying to convert a `string` value which is not a valid date format. This could potentially happen especially when our code is consuming data from user inputs or other data sources that we never control. To fix that, we can use the [DateTime.TryParse()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.datetime.tryparse?view=netcore-3.1) method to safely handle the conversion as shown in the following:

```csharp
string dateString = "60/1011/2020"; // this is an invalid date
var isValid = DateTime.TryParse(dateString, out var date);

if (isValid)
{
   // date is valid
}  
```

You can see that our code is now safe to handle `DateTime` conversion, however, the code is kinda long to just do a basic conversion. Imagine you have a lot of the same conversion cluttering within the different areas of your project. That could be messy and may cost you a bit of development time. To avoid that, you would end up creating some helper functions that do common tasks such as conversions. 

With `HelpMate.Core`, you don't need to write helper functions yourself anymore every time you implement a new project that do common things, not unless if necessary. Instead, you can just plug this package into your project and then you're good to go.

Here's a sample usage on how to do `DateTime` conversion easily:

```csharp
string dateString = "60/1011/2020"; // this is an invalid date
var date = dateString.ToDateTime();

if (date.IsValidDateTime())
{
   // Date is valid
}  
```

As you could probably guessed, the implementation in the preceding code is somewhat similar to `DateTime.TryParse()`. Yes it is and in fact, it uses the `DateTime.TryParse()` method under the hood. The goal is to provide convenience and to make your code much cleaner and shorter.
